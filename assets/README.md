## Paid Assets

This project uses paid assets. That means that some of the assets in this folder
DO NOT follow the same license as the remainder of the project. Some of these
paid assets may be modified in accordance with the terms of their licenses.

For information about exactly which assets are paid, please contact the project owner.

Please support the authors of these paid assets by purchasing them yourself:

* [RPG Dungeon Tileset](https://pita.itch.io/rpg-dungeon-tileset)
* [RPG Monster Pack](https://pita.itch.io/rpg-monster-pack)

Note: users need to purchase a license for themselves if they wish to use any of
these paid assets in another project of their own.
